# IoT Garage Door Simulator

A **desktop-based IoT Garage Door simulation** built with Python and Tkinter.  
This project allows you to **simulate opening and closing a garage door** and logs all actions with timestamps.

---

## üî• Features

- Open/Close the garage door using GUI buttons  
- Real-time **Door Status** indicator (Red = Closed, Green = Open)  
- **Action Log** displaying timestamps of all operations  
- Fully desktop-based simulation (no hardware required)  
- Easy to extend with multiple doors or networked IoT simulation

## üõ† Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x  
- **GUI Library:** Tkinter  
- **OS:** Linux, Windows, macOS

##üß© How It Works##
The door state is stored in a variable (Open or Closed).

Clicking Open or Close updates the state.

The status label changes color:

Red = Closed

Green = Open

Every action is logged with a timestamp in the action log.

##üí° Future Improvements##
Add multiple garage doors simulation

Integrate a Flask web dashboard for remote control

Add real-time notifications or IoT integration


Add keyboard shortcuts to control the door
